Connect to RedPitaya
####################

This is the most common and recommended way of
connecting and using your Red Pitaya boards.
Your LAN network needs to have DHCP settings enabled
which is the case in majority of the local networks.
With this, simple *plug and play* approach is enabled.
Having RedPitaya board connected the local network
will enable quick access to all Red Pitaya applications
using only your web browser.
Simply follow this 3 simple steps:

#. Connect RedPitaya board to the router
#. Connect power supply to the Red Pitaya board
#. Open your web browser and in the URL filed type ``rp-xxxxxx.local/``

.. note:: 

    For arranging other types of connections (wireless, direct ethernet connection) use the  
    :ref:`Network manager application <networkManager>`.
       
.. note::

   ``xxxxxx`` are the last 6 characters from MAC address of your RedPitaya board.
   MAC address is written on the Ethernet connector.
